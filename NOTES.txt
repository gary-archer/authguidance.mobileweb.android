NEXT STEPS
----------
1. Receive proper error objects from mobile
   Handle login cancellation case first
   Manage serialization and deserialization on the SPA side
   Handle startup errors, login cancelled errors and AppAuth errors
   Maybe have a getStartupError mobile method that the SPA calls

2. Receive claimed https scheme response
   Fix app signing
   Try updating the assetlinks.json file and the Android manifest file
   Is it possible to run 2 samples with same scheme?
   Workaround development proxy setup where registration fails

3. Async Reliability
   Do a pause for 10 seconds in Kotlin during reload
   Check that UI thread is not tied up and is still responsive

4. UX
   Styles for tablet and test under this resolution
   Show ExpireRefreshToken button in SPA for mobile case
   isLoggedIn state to update in webViewAuthenticator

SETUP NOTES
-----------
1. Requires proxy to be running to see web.mycompany.com

2. console.log('GJA: ...') statements from SPA show up in logcat

3. @JavascriptInterface makes mobileAuthenticator methods available to SPA
