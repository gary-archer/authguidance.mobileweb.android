NEXT STEPS
----------
1. Get Okta working equivalently
   Add a new trust entry and get configuration file working

2. UX
   Verify tablet case looks OK and add styles for this resolution if needed
   Show ExpireRefreshToken button in SPA for mobile case

3. OAuth Failure Scenarios and UI
   Test refresh token expired etc
   Improve stack trace display based on authenticator being used

4. Startup Reliability
   Show mobile startup errors in the SPA
   Pressing Home should retry loading the mobile configuration

5. Async Reliability
   Do a pause for 10 seconds in Kotlin during reload
   Check that UI thread is not tied up and is still responsive

6. ReEntrancy
   Multiple redirects at once when Home is clicked multiple times from LoginRequired
   Fix for main mobile apps if required
   Can I improve performance, which feels sluggish?

7. Design
   Think more about webDomain v interstitialDomain naming
   Should be able to debug SPA code without impacting custom scheme registration
   Do this as a unit where I also update blog posts + Android / iOS samples

8. Blog write up
   Update screenshots to Android 4 for mobile setup / AppAuth sample
   Important point will be running mobile code locally + running SPA code locally

SETUP NOTES
-----------
1. Requires proxy to be running to see web.mycompany.com
   OK for initial development but running without a proxy is preferred
