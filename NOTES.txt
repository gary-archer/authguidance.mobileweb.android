NEXT STEPS
----------
1. Receive claimed https scheme response
   Add app signing for webview mobile app via KeyStore Explorer
   Update interstitial page to return to different locations based on client id perhaps
   Try updating the assetlinks.json file without breaking old sample
   Is it possible to run 2 samples with same scheme?

2. Startup Reliability
   Show startup errors in the SPA
   Pressing Home should retry loading the mobile configuration

3. Async Reliability
   Do a pause for 10 seconds in Kotlin during reload
   Check that UI thread is not tied up and is still responsive

4. ReEntrancy
   Multiple redirects at once when Home is clicked multiple times from LoginRequired
   Fix for main mobile apps if required

5. UX
   Get running on tablet looking OK
   Do I need styles for this resolution?
   Show ExpireRefreshToken button in SPA for mobile case

6. Design
   Think more about webDomain v interstitialDomain
   Get rid of SPA host serving interstitial page?

7. Blog write up
   Update screenshots to Android 4 for mobile setup / AppAuth sample

SETUP NOTES
-----------
1. Requires proxy to be running to see web.mycompany.com
   OK for initial development but running without a proxy is preferred
