0. Blog write up
   Update screenshots to Android 4 for mobile setup / AppAuth sample

1. Mobile Startup
   Output a basic view of the error to the UI and prompt the user to restart the app

   Fix for main mobile apps if required
   Can I improve performance, which feels sluggish?

SETUP NOTES
-----------
1. Requires proxy to be running to see web.mycompany.com
   OK for initial development but running without a proxy is preferred

2. SPA development is tricky and works best with deployed SPA
