SETUP
-----
1. Requires proxy to be running to see web.mycompany.com

2. console.log('GJA: ...') statements from SPA show up in logcat

3. @JavascriptInterface makes mobileAuthenticator methods available to SPA

NEXT STEPS
----------
1. Get startup code working, including loading of configuration file

2. Create authenticators
   webView.authenticator needs a reference to the webview
   Get async callbacks working
   Use GUIDs for unique window callback references

3. Startup errors
   Store these in the mobile app and return to the web view later

4. Get login redirects working once refresh fails

5. Get responses working via claimed https schemes
   Tricky in terms of developer setup

CURRENT STATE
-------------
Working on feature branch of Final SPA
Working on Android mobile web view side by side
Async handling in progress but mobile authenticator needs a reference to the web view
