1. First login redirect steps
   Plug in main authenticator class and aim to avoid changing it

2. Claimed https scheme conflicts with main sample
   Is it possible to run 2 samples with same scheme?
   Developer setup means registration will fail

3. Consider naming entry point interfaces 'bridge' rather than authenticator

4. app signing is broken
   launch icon label should be shortened to 'Demo'

5. Get full error remoting working
