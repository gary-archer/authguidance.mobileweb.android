SETUP
-----
1. Requires proxy to be running to see web.mycompany.com

2. console.log('GJA: ...') statements from SPA show up in logcat

3. @JavascriptInterface makes mobileAuthenticator methods available to SPA

NEXT STEPS
----------
1. Get startup code working, including loading of configuration file
   General updates in line with main Android sample
   Store startup errors from loading configuration in the mobile app and give to the web view later

2. Synchronise calls to getAccessToken and enable API calls
   Result should be a 401 after the retry

3. Get login redirects working and tokens returning
   Will be tricky with claimed https schemes
   Tricky in terms of registration with Charles running and without impacting main sample

4. Consider naming entry point interfaces 'bridge' rather than authenticator

5. Get app signing working

CURRENT STATE
-------------
Working on feature branch of Final SPA
